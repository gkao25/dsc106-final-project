<h1>How much does CO2 emission affect climate change?</h1>

<div class="explanation">
    The dangerous environmental changes have been a large problem in the modern 
    world, causing a slow approach towards inhabitable weather/temperature and a 
    high increase in both the volume and severity of natural disasters. In this 
    project, we explore a potential cause of one of the temperature changes: 
    air pollution. 
</div>
<h2>
    Is there a causal correlation between the amount of CO2 emission per state 
    and its temperature?
</h2>

    If you shift through the different states via the dropdown menu, you can 
    see the average temperature and total CO2 emission changes over the years. 
    The lines do not show a clear growing nor declining trend, making it 
    difficult to assess the correlation between the two variables. 
    <br>
    Thus, rather than comparing the change in time for each state, we would like 
    to compare the states more directly via the choropleth map below.

<div class="explanation">

    The color of each state show the relative temperature - the bluer the color, the 
    colder it usually is, and the redder, the hotter. We can see that this 
    aligns with our expectations of northern states generally being colder than 
    the southern states, and it's consisten throughout the years. We also notice 
    that the northern states do seem to become more and more red over the years, 
    and it's particularly visible if you compare the first year of data, 1970, 
    with the latest, 2023.
